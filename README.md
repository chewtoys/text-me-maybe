Text Me Maybe is a web app that allows you to send texts without revealing your phone number! Each text thread will have its own unique phone number, and deleting a text thread will dissociate yourself from that phone number entirely. Built with JavaScript using React, Node.js, GraphQL, and TypeORM. Delivering and receiving SMS is powered by the the Twilio API.

## Why?

A match in one of your dating apps wants to text you to schedule a date. You're not so sure you want to give out your number, if the other person ends up being a creep, them having your phone number seems non-ideal. But you don't want to say no. _ENTER TEXT ME MAYBE._ Start a new message thread, and all of your messages will come from a unique phone number. If something goes wrong, delete the message thread, and the phone number deactivates instantly!
