Text Me Maybe is a web app that allows you to send texts without revealing your phone number! Each text thread will have its own unique phone number, and deleting a text thread will dissociate yourself from that phone number entirely. Built with JavaScript using React, Node.js, GraphQL, and TypeORM. Delivering and receiving SMS is powered by the the Twilio API.

## Why?

A match in one of your dating apps wants to text you to schedule a date. You're not so sure you want to give out your number, if the other person ends up being a creep, them having your phone number seems non-ideal. But you don't want to say no. _ENTER TEXT ME MAYBE._ Start a new message thread, and all of your messages will come from a unique phone number. If something goes wrong, delete the message thread, and the phone number deactivates instantly!


## Vision Doc

#### Thing I Want To Do In A Reasonable Time Frame

- Phone Number Pooling
    - Phone number allocation based on area code (something to think about, maybe state-based?)
    - Minimize the length of phone numbers in our system.
- Improve the UX
- Error Handling
- Thread Pagination w/ infinite scrolls

#### Things Eventually Want To Do But Might Be Low Priority

This stuff I'm not particularly interested implementing _personally_, but I would be more than happy to if **you** are interested! :)

- Landing Screen
- Billing
- Code Splitting
- List virtualization

#### Things That Will Make This Pitchable To VCs

- Pitch Deck
- Profitability Calculations
- Numbers
- Triangle Graphs
- Pie Tables
- Quadrant Charts
